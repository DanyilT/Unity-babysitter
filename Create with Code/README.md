## About the Course

The "Create with Code" course is a comprehensive introduction to Unity and game development. It is designed for beginners with no prior experience in coding or game development (not me ðŸ™„). Throughout the course, you will learn the basics of C# programming, Unity's interface, and essential game development concepts.
- [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code)

### Key Learning Objectives

- **Understand Unity's Interface**: Learn how to navigate and utilize Unity's powerful interface and tools.
- **C# Programming**: Get introduced to C# programming and understand how to write scripts to control game objects.
- **Game Mechanics**: Implement core game mechanics such as player movement, collision detection, and scoring systems.
- **Sound and Effects**: Add sound effects and visual effects to enhance the gaming experience.
- **User Interface**: Create and manage user interfaces, including menus, buttons, and HUD elements.
- **Project-Based Learning**: Apply your knowledge through hands-on projects and build your own games from scratch.

### Course Structure

The course is divided into several units, each focusing on different aspects of game development:

1. [**Player Control**](#player-control): Learn how to control game objects and implement player movement.
2. [**Basic Gameplay**](#basic-gameplay): Understand the fundamentals of gameplay mechanics and interactions.
3. [**Sound and Effects**](#sound-and-effects): Add audio and visual effects to your game.
4. [**Gameplay Mechanics**](#gameplay-mechanics): Dive deeper into more complex gameplay mechanics.
5. [**User Interface**](#user-interface): Create and manage user interfaces for your game.

### About Easter Eggs

- I put an ester egg in each game. ðŸ« 
- You can read 'egg code' in `SomethingIsHappeningThere.cs` in `<project-name>/Assets/Scripts/` folder.
- Tip: `qwerty`
